// some curated entries) breaks for three real-world layouts the HF API reveals:
//   1. The quant lives in a subfolder (bartowski ships big quants as
//      `<base>-<Quant>/<file>.gguf`), not at the repo root.
//   2. The quant is split into multiple parts (`-00001-of-0000N.gguf`). Every
//      part must land in ONE folder for llama.cpp / LM Studio to load it as a
//      single model. `ollama pull` cannot consume split GGUF at all
//      (ollama/ollama#5245) · direct multi-part download is the only sound path.
//   3. The guessed single-file name simply doesn't exist (404).
// Resolving against the real tree fixes all three.
